    <h2 style="text-align: center;"> The Proof We Have So Far </h2>
    <p class="text">  With an increase in sketchy behavior from certain individuals, we have started to investigate why there is such an increase in the amount of strange individuals. At first we thought that it was due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to people going insane from staying inside all day. But after noticing significant changes in people's behavior, we concluded that it had to be way worse. Personally, I decided to do more research to see if there were any cases like this before. At first I could'nt find anything, but then I stumbled across an old theory that people were dissappearing and being replaced by reptilian creatures who would disguise themselves as humans. They called them "Lizard People." The changes that they found lined up perfectly with what we have observed just recently; social awkwardness, change in personality, and an appetite for insects. I presented these findings with the rest of my team and we all came to the conclusion that Lizard People are real and living among us right now. </p>

    <h1 style="text-align: center;"> What to do with this information </h1>
    <p class="text"> We suggest that you stay away from anybody that you suspect to be a lizard person. Although we do not know exactly how aggresive theses lizard people can be, it is always good to show caution in their presence. At the moment, observing them to learn more about of their behaviors is the best option. </p>
